Alright, here is the fix one by one you have to work one with, find the best optimal solution over it
popup, canvas zoom oen,

1.  ![alt text](image.png) this toolbar or tool pallet
    whenever i hover on tools, it should always show the arrow(select) pointer, the problem i see when i select pen the pen icon and it shows pen icon as pointer even when i hover on the tool bar div, fix that for every tool

2.  For pen tool there is a pointer error i can see
    both pen and the arrow pointer, so when on canvas area keep it only the icon and when hover on the toolbar area it should be the arrow(select) pointer

3.  in eraser tool, provide two option selecting the element delet or the pixel delete

4.  tool, in this what need to be fixed is that when i place a note and when i hover over it i can see two icon get overallap in pointer first is pen and the second is text icon so fix that by whenever a note is placed the slect tool should be auto slected

5.  Similar to the note , text tool hase same problem fix that the same, by auto selecting the select tool after text is placed

alright so i see the problem now for both note and text tool when placed i can see whenver i hver on rither of them the two icons are over lapping reomve the pen icon hover when hovered on their are of both
its really a precise work to be done alright, so do professinoal work no mistakes

6. in color slection tool can you provide six default color and then the a option to to chose cutom color

now over chnages

7.  there need to be fixed that when sclaed up or down the canvas the pen tool dont write precise where it is been drawn fix that

on deleting notes, or textor clear tool i get an alert remove that directly delete that and add undo fucntionality to that

crete todo and work one by one
